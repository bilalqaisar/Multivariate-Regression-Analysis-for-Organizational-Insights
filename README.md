# Multivariate-Regression-Analysis-for-Organizational-Insights
Conducted a regression analysis project to explore relationships between organizational factors and employee performance metrics.
Utilized statistical techniques to analyze the impact of independent variables (e.g., leadership, motivation, and resources) on performance, with mediators and moderators incorporated into the model. 
Preprocessed data using Python and advanced libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib. 
The project provided actionable insights into the dynamics of organizational behavior and its influence on employee outcomes
